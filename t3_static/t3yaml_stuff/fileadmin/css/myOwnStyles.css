**  Date     : 23.8.07
**  File     : myOwnStyles.css
**  Function : This file is not part of the YAML-CSS-Framework.
**             It was included to give the user the possibility to quickly apply tests, changes or
**             whatever with no need to change the YAML-files and mess up anything.
**             Hmmm. Does this make sense? Anyway, use it or just leave it empty. It will do no harm.
**             This is the last stylesheet beeing imported. So, everything can be overwritten here.
**             Be careful what you put in here and don't hold us responsible for anything that goes wrong...
